In this paper, we develop a purposive artificial intelligence based formulation for the problem of general navigation. We call this AI framework "Embodied AI" - AI design based on the knowledge of agent's hardware limitations and timing/computation constraints. Following this design philosophy we develop a complete AI navigation stack for dodging multiple dynamic obstacles on a quadrotor with a monocular event camera and computation. We also present an approach to directly transfer the shallow neural networks trained in simulation to the real world by subsuming pre-processing using a neural network into the pipeline.
